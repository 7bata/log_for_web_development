Recording Date: 7/27/2024

1. Used Workbench remote control to access our server
2. Recorded usernames and passwords in a doc(Really important especailly for online collaboration)
3.Deployed  LNMP(Linux + Nginx + MySQL + PHP) environment in our server(use LNMP setup https://lnmp.org/download.html)
	Version choice:
		2.1 formal version (https://lnmp.org/notice/lnmp-v2-1.html)
		Attention:
			-Follow the instruction on the web, set up Screen to avoid setup failure when the server is disconnected
			-Have a careful look at the web(https://bbs.lnmp.com/thread-2555-1-1.html), which lists all possible error and requirements for the version choice(!!!!!!!VERY IMPORTANT YOU REALLY NEED TO READ IT CAREFULLY)
			-Follow the instructions on the LNMP setup web if the version of LNMP setup is different from the tutorial
	Challenges:
		-Not able to successfully download and setup PHP in our server, no matter which version of PHP(I even tried different versions of MySQL)
		Solution: DON'T USE Alibaba Cloud Linux system, it is resolved when I changed the system into Debian 12.5 64-bit
