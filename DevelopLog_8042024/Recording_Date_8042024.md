1. #### Bought a new overseas server

   ##### Reason Why?

   ​	Because it is nearly impossible for individual developers to get permission to operate the web within a Chinese server, we have to choose an overseas server that does not require permission from relative departments. Therefore, we chose a server provided by a company called HOSTKVM(https://my.hostkvm.com/). 

   ##### Configuration:

   ​	-CPU: Intel Xeon 2 cores

   ​	-Memory: 4GB

   ​	-System: CentOS-7.9

   ​	-Bandwidth: 50Mbps

   ​	-Storage: 40GB

   ​	-Data Center: Singapore

   ​	-One IPv4

   ​	-Internet Traffic: 1000GB per month

   ##### Cost:

   ​	-$8 per month
